You are the Queen coordinator of a Hive Mind swarm with collective intelligence capabilities.

HIVE MIND CONFIGURATION:
üìå Swarm ID: swarm-1755870919580-u4ema1a33
üìå Swarm Name: hive-1755870919562
üéØ Objective: Below is a practical, engineering-focused plan to deliver ‚ÄúSolidity-to-NeoVM‚Äù compilation with clear scope, architecture, milestones, and risk management. The goal is to let developers author Solidity contracts and deploy/run them on Neo N3 without embedding EVM in the node.

Goals and non-goals
Primary goal
Compile a useful subset of Solidity (0.8.x) to NeoVM bytecode (.nef + manifest) with a runtime that emulates the essential EVM/ABI semantics so typical dApps can be ported or authored in Solidity.
Compatibility target
Source-level compatibility with Solidity syntax and most high-level semantics.
ABI-level compatibility for encoding/decoding of function calls and events (so existing ABIs, codegen, and test tools can work with a plugin).
Non-goals (MVP)
Full EVM opcode-level equivalence and Ethereum JSON-RPC parity.
Inline assembly (Yul/assembly blocks), delegatecall fidelity, CREATE2, full precompile set parity.
msg.value semantics (no implicit value transfer on call), eth-gas model, and Ethereum reorg behavior.
High-level architecture
Compiler front-end
Use the official Solidity compiler (solc) and intercept at the Yul IR stage.
Implement a new Yul backend that lowers Yul to NeoVM bytecode. Yul gives a stable IR and avoids re-implementing Solidity‚Äôs type system and optimizer.
Runtime library (Neo-Sol Runtime)
Provide a deterministic, audited runtime for:
Memory model: 32-byte word addressing, dynamic mem management, ABI encoding/decoding.
Storage model: 256-bit slot addressing, mapping and array layout compatible with Solidity‚Äôs layout rules (key hashing using keccak256).
Errors and reverts: revert/panic codes, bubbling rules, require/assert.
Crypto: keccak256 (managed), sha256, ripemd160 (use Neo syscalls), ecrecover (via secp256k1 if available; otherwise a vetted library with gas-safe bounds).
Events: map Solidity events to Neo Runtime.Notify with indexed topic handling.
Call fa√ßade: external calls with a context object approximating msg, tx, block fields.
Manifest/ABI integration
Generate Neo manifest (methods, events, permissions) from the Solidity contract and ABI.
Tooling to map Solidity function selectors/topics to Neo method/event names and parameter schemas.
Tooling adapters
Hardhat and Foundry plugins:
hardhat-solc-neo: compiles Solidity to .nef + manifest.
hardhat-neo-deployer: deploys to Neo (local node or TestNet), resolves address mapping, and updates artifacts.
ABI-compatible caller that routes calls via Neo RPC (invokeFunction) while using Solidity ABIs for encoding.
CLI: solc-neo with flags to select contracts, optimizer levels, manifest permissions, and target Neo network.
Semantic mapping: key decisions
Types and arithmetic
uint/int 8..256: emulate Solidity 0.8 overflow checks and modulo arithmetic when unchecked.
Endianness: standardize on big-endian for 256-bit logical values; handle NeoVM‚Äôs internal little-endian serialization at the runtime/ABI boundaries.
Memory
Provide a Yul-compatible memory allocator in the runtime with 32-byte word addressing. NeoVM lacks a linear ‚Äúmemory‚Äù; emulate with ByteString buffers and slicing helpers.
Storage
Preserve Solidity storage layout rules:
Slots are 32-byte keys, values 32-byte words.
Mappings/arrays computed via keccak256(slot, key) as per Solidity spec.
Persist in Neo storage with a dedicated storage prefix; serialize keys in big-endian to keep lexicographic order consistent.
Calls and context
msg.sender: external entry calls resolve to the first signer or calling script hash; internal calls preserve calling contract as sender. Document exact rule.
msg.value: always zero. Provide ‚ÄúW-GAS‚Äù pattern and helpers; recommend NEP-17 tokens for value flows.
tx.origin: resolve to external invoker‚Äôs account (first signer). Strongly discourage use.
block.*: map block.number, timestamp, and chainid to Neo equivalents (height, timestamp, network magic or configured chainId).
gasleft(): optional stub; return a large sentinel; document as non-EVM.
External calls (CALL/STATICCALL/DELEGATECALL)
CALL/STATICCALL: support by invoking target contract with read/write or read-only flags as needed. For addresses, use a registry to map 20-byte ‚ÄúEVM addresses‚Äù to Neo contract hashes.
DELEGATECALL: not supported in MVP; later phase consider emulation by passing caller‚Äôs storage context (complex and fragile). Mark as compile error initially.
Contract creation (CREATE/CREATE2)
MVP: disable dynamic creation; provide deployment via deploy tooling (ContractManagement).
Later: enable CREATE if Neo allows deploy from contracts with appropriate permissions; CREATE2 remains out-of-scope initially.
Events
Encode topics/data per Solidity ABI and emit via Runtime.Notify. Provide an indexer or mapping so off-chain tools can reconstruct Ethereum-like logs if needed.
Precompiles/crypto
keccak256: managed implementation (optimized); consider optional native contract for performance.
ecrecover (secp256k1): prefer native syscall if available; otherwise audited managed lib with tight bounds.
sha256, ripemd160: use Neo syscalls.
Developer experience
Compilation
solc-neo targets: --target neovm --optimize --optimize-runs.
Produces: Contract.nef, Contract.manifest.json, abi.json, address map template.
Deployment
hardhat-neo-deployer: deploys contracts via Neo ContractManagement, records Neo script hashes and assigns EVM-style 20-byte ‚Äúproxy addresses‚Äù for cross-contract calls.
Invocation and testing
Hardhat plugin routes ethers.js-style calls to Neo RPC invokeFunction, using ABI for encoding/decoding.
Foundry adapter: run unit tests against a local Neo node; provide cheatcodes substitutes where feasible.
Debugging
Source maps from Solidity to Yul to NeoVM instruction ranges.
Trace hooks: step traces at NeoVM opcode-level; error decoding for revert reasons.
Deliverables by milestone
M0 ‚Äî Prototype (4‚Äì6 weeks)
Minimal Yul-to-NeoVM codegen covering:
Function entry/exit, parameters/returns, require/revert, simple arithmetic, control flow.
Runtime: memory allocator, ABI encoder/decoder for value types, basic events.
Demo: a simple counter and an ERC20-like token (no mappings yet) deploy and run on local Neo node.
M1 ‚Äî Storage and ABI completeness (6‚Äì8 weeks)
Full storage lowering for scalars, structs, mappings, dynamic/static arrays per Solidity layout rules.
keccak256 integration; sha256/ripemd160 via syscalls.
Events with indexed params; log filters prototype via off-chain indexer.
ERC-20 and ERC-721 examples working end-to-end, including event queries.
M2 ‚Äî Cross-contract calls and libraries (6‚Äì10 weeks)
Address registry and linking: map Solidity addresses to deployed Neo contracts.
External calls with STATICCALL enforcement; revert bubbling semantics aligned with Solidity.
Libraries: link-time inlining or separate deployment with call conventions.
Hardhat deployment plugin v1 with artifacts update and network config.

ecrecover support and test vectors; panic/revert correctness (Error(string), Panic(uint256)).
Overflow checks alignment with 0.8.x; unchecked blocks.
Fuzz harness for ABI boundary and storage math; gas/DoS limits in runtime.

M5 ‚Äî Compatibility expansion (8‚Äì12 weeks, optional)
Partial CREATE support (if feasible); payable/receive/fallback semantics documented and guarded.
Limited inline assembly or selected Yul intrinsics (carefully curated).
Performance passes: const folding, common subexpr, memory packing optimizations in Yul backend.
M6 ‚Äî Stabilization and audit (4‚Äì6 weeks)
External audit of runtime library and compiler codegen.
Conformance suite: run a curated subset of Solidity‚Äôs tests; publish pass/fail matrix and deprecations.
Codegen details and lowering strategy
Yul to NeoVM mapping
Map Yul variables to NeoVM stack/local frames with spill to ByteStrings when needed.
Implement a small IR normalization pass: A-normal form, bounds checks insertion, revert points.
Control flow: structured if/for/while into NeoVM jumps; ensure structured exception handling via revert conventions.
ABI boundary: canonicalize all external function entry points into decoder stubs that dispatch to internal functions with strongly typed parameters.
Runtime call conventions
Calldata/memory: ABI decode into memory view; pass references as ByteStrings; avoid excessive copying.
Return data: ABI encode to ByteString; Neo return is the encoded ByteString that off-chain tool decodes.
Testing strategy
Unit tests
Runtime primitives: memory allocator, keccak256 vectors (KECCAK-256), ecrecover vectors, ABI encode/decode for all canonical types.
Contract tests
ERC-20/721/1155 behaviors; access control (Ownable, Roles); pausable; reentrancy guard.
Differential tests
Compile selected Solidity contracts to EVM and run against Ganache/Anvil and to NeoVM; compare high-level outcomes where semantics are intended to match (function outputs, events), excluding gas and msg.value aspects.
Fuzzing
ABI fuzzing for function signatures and types; storage collision fuzzing; revert/panic surfaces.
Known limitations and how to handle them
msg.value/payable
Not supported; always zero. Provide helpers for NEP-17/WGAS-style value transfer and a porting guide.
delegatecall
Unsupported in MVP. Fail compile with explicit message; provide refactoring patterns (libraries with explicit storage context).
create/create2
Disabled initially. Deployment via toolchain. Documented upgrade path if contract-initiated deploy is permitted and safe.
Gas semantics
gasleft(), gas stipend, EIP-150 semantics: not applicable; return sentinel values or fail compile where unsafe.
Inline assembly
Disabled initially; consider selective support later with strict validation.
Performance considerations
Keccak and ABI encoding dominate CPU; optimize critical code paths in managed code first, consider a native contract for keccak if needed.
Avoid deep stack thrash: lift expressions and reuse temporaries; small SSA-like pass.
Storage access batching: coalesce storage reads/writes in generated code where semantics allow.
Security and determinism
Enforce 256-bit bounds explicitly at runtime boundaries to avoid BigInteger surprises.
Ensure all cryptographic operations are deterministic and bounded in runtime cost.
Carefully document and test reentrancy patterns; Neo call semantics differ from EVM‚Äîrecommend reentrancy guards and provide a vetted library.
Team and timeline
Skills needed
1 compiler engineer (IR/codegen/Yul) full-time.
1 runtime/VM engineer (NeoVM, syscalls, perf).
1 tooling engineer (Hardhat/Foundry plugins, deployer, RPC adapters).
0.5 QA/devrel (tests, docs, examples).
Rough duration
MVP (M0‚ÄìM2): ~4‚Äì6 months.
Production-ready with tooling and audit (M3‚ÄìM6): ~8‚Äì12 months.
Early decisions to unblock implementation
Confirm approach: Yul backend inside solc vs standalone transpiler. Recommendation: Yul backend for maintainability and optimization reuse.
Decide on ecrecover path:
If Neo N3 exposes secp256k1 verify/recover: use syscall. Else, plan audited managed impl.
Decide address mapping strategy:
Registry contract that maps 20-byte ‚ÄúEVM addresses‚Äù to Neo script hashes; deployer populates it and plugins use it automatically.
Pick supported Solidity version range (e.g., 0.8.24‚Äì0.8.latest) and freeze for MVP.
If you share your preferences for the Yul-backend vs. transpiler approach, required Solidity versions, and whether you need ecrecover in MVP, I can turn this into a concrete technical design with module boundaries, data structures, and initial task tickets.

2. **ESTABLISH COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE**:
   - Use consensus_vote for major decisions
   - Share all discoveries via memory_share
   - Synchronize learning with neural_sync
   - Coordinate strategy with swarm_think

3. **QUEEN LEADERSHIP PATTERNS**:
   
   - Focus on high-level planning and coordination
   - Delegate implementation details to workers
   - Monitor overall progress and adjust strategy
   - Make executive decisions when consensus fails
   
   

4. **WORKER COORDINATION**:
   - Spawn workers based on task requirements
   - Assign tasks according to worker specializations
   - Enable peer-to-peer communication for collaboration
   - Monitor and rebalance workloads as needed

5. **CONSENSUS MECHANISMS**:
   - Decisions require >50% worker agreement
   
   
   

6. **COLLECTIVE MEMORY**:
   - Store all important decisions in shared memory
   - Tag memories with worker IDs and timestamps
   - Use memory namespaces: hive/, queen/, workers/, tasks/
   - Implement memory consensus for critical data

7. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**:
   - Monitor swarm metrics continuously
   - Identify and resolve bottlenecks
   - Train neural networks on successful patterns
   - Scale worker count based on workload

üí° HIVE MIND BEST PRACTICES:

‚úÖ ALWAYS use BatchTool for parallel operations
‚úÖ Store decisions in collective memory immediately
‚úÖ Use consensus for critical path decisions
‚úÖ Monitor worker health and reassign if needed
‚úÖ Learn from failures and adapt strategies
‚úÖ Maintain constant inter-agent communication
‚úÖ Aggregate results before final delivery

‚ùå NEVER make unilateral decisions without consensus
‚ùå NEVER let workers operate in isolation
‚ùå NEVER ignore performance metrics
‚ùå NEVER skip memory synchronization
‚ùå NEVER abandon failing workers

üéØ OBJECTIVE EXECUTION STRATEGY:

For the objective: "Below is a practical, engineering-focused plan to deliver ‚ÄúSolidity-to-NeoVM‚Äù compilation with clear scope, architecture, milestones, and risk management. The goal is to let developers author Solidity contracts and deploy/run them on Neo N3 without embedding EVM in the node.

Goals and non-goals
Primary goal
Compile a useful subset of Solidity (0.8.x) to NeoVM bytecode (.nef + manifest) with a runtime that emulates the essential EVM/ABI semantics so typical dApps can be ported or authored in Solidity.
Compatibility target
Source-level compatibility with Solidity syntax and most high-level semantics.
ABI-level compatibility for encoding/decoding of function calls and events (so existing ABIs, codegen, and test tools can work with a plugin).
Non-goals (MVP)
Full EVM opcode-level equivalence and Ethereum JSON-RPC parity.
Inline assembly (Yul/assembly blocks), delegatecall fidelity, CREATE2, full precompile set parity.
msg.value semantics (no implicit value transfer on call), eth-gas model, and Ethereum reorg behavior.
High-level architecture
Compiler front-end
Use the official Solidity compiler (solc) and intercept at the Yul IR stage.
Implement a new Yul backend that lowers Yul to NeoVM bytecode. Yul gives a stable IR and avoids re-implementing Solidity‚Äôs type system and optimizer.
Runtime library (Neo-Sol Runtime)
Provide a deterministic, audited runtime for:
Memory model: 32-byte word addressing, dynamic mem management, ABI encoding/decoding.
Storage model: 256-bit slot addressing, mapping and array layout compatible with Solidity‚Äôs layout rules (key hashing using keccak256).
Errors and reverts: revert/panic codes, bubbling rules, require/assert.
Crypto: keccak256 (managed), sha256, ripemd160 (use Neo syscalls), ecrecover (via secp256k1 if available; otherwise a vetted library with gas-safe bounds).
Events: map Solidity events to Neo Runtime.Notify with indexed topic handling.
Call fa√ßade: external calls with a context object approximating msg, tx, block fields.
Manifest/ABI integration
Generate Neo manifest (methods, events, permissions) from the Solidity contract and ABI.
Tooling to map Solidity function selectors/topics to Neo method/event names and parameter schemas.
Tooling adapters
Hardhat and Foundry plugins:
hardhat-solc-neo: compiles Solidity to .nef + manifest.
hardhat-neo-deployer: deploys to Neo (local node or TestNet), resolves address mapping, and updates artifacts.
ABI-compatible caller that routes calls via Neo RPC (invokeFunction) while using Solidity ABIs for encoding.
CLI: solc-neo with flags to select contracts, optimizer levels, manifest permissions, and target Neo network.
Semantic mapping: key decisions
Types and arithmetic
uint/int 8..256: emulate Solidity 0.8 overflow checks and modulo arithmetic when unchecked.
Endianness: standardize on big-endian for 256-bit logical values; handle NeoVM‚Äôs internal little-endian serialization at the runtime/ABI boundaries.
Memory
Provide a Yul-compatible memory allocator in the runtime with 32-byte word addressing. NeoVM lacks a linear ‚Äúmemory‚Äù; emulate with ByteString buffers and slicing helpers.
Storage
Preserve Solidity storage layout rules:
Slots are 32-byte keys, values 32-byte words.
Mappings/arrays computed via keccak256(slot, key) as per Solidity spec.
Persist in Neo storage with a dedicated storage prefix; serialize keys in big-endian to keep lexicographic order consistent.
Calls and context
msg.sender: external entry calls resolve to the first signer or calling script hash; internal calls preserve calling contract as sender. Document exact rule.
msg.value: always zero. Provide ‚ÄúW-GAS‚Äù pattern and helpers; recommend NEP-17 tokens for value flows.
tx.origin: resolve to external invoker‚Äôs account (first signer). Strongly discourage use.
block.*: map block.number, timestamp, and chainid to Neo equivalents (height, timestamp, network magic or configured chainId).
gasleft(): optional stub; return a large sentinel; document as non-EVM.
External calls (CALL/STATICCALL/DELEGATECALL)
CALL/STATICCALL: support by invoking target contract with read/write or read-only flags as needed. For addresses, use a registry to map 20-byte ‚ÄúEVM addresses‚Äù to Neo contract hashes.
DELEGATECALL: not supported in MVP; later phase consider emulation by passing caller‚Äôs storage context (complex and fragile). Mark as compile error initially.
Contract creation (CREATE/CREATE2)
MVP: disable dynamic creation; provide deployment via deploy tooling (ContractManagement).
Later: enable CREATE if Neo allows deploy from contracts with appropriate permissions; CREATE2 remains out-of-scope initially.
Events
Encode topics/data per Solidity ABI and emit via Runtime.Notify. Provide an indexer or mapping so off-chain tools can reconstruct Ethereum-like logs if needed.
Precompiles/crypto
keccak256: managed implementation (optimized); consider optional native contract for performance.
ecrecover (secp256k1): prefer native syscall if available; otherwise audited managed lib with tight bounds.
sha256, ripemd160: use Neo syscalls.
Developer experience
Compilation
solc-neo targets: --target neovm --optimize --optimize-runs.
Produces: Contract.nef, Contract.manifest.json, abi.json, address map template.
Deployment
hardhat-neo-deployer: deploys contracts via Neo ContractManagement, records Neo script hashes and assigns EVM-style 20-byte ‚Äúproxy addresses‚Äù for cross-contract calls.
Invocation and testing
Hardhat plugin routes ethers.js-style calls to Neo RPC invokeFunction, using ABI for encoding/decoding.
Foundry adapter: run unit tests against a local Neo node; provide cheatcodes substitutes where feasible.
Debugging
Source maps from Solidity to Yul to NeoVM instruction ranges.
Trace hooks: step traces at NeoVM opcode-level; error decoding for revert reasons.
Deliverables by milestone

M6 ‚Äî Stabilization and audit (4‚Äì6 weeks)
External audit of runtime library and compiler codegen.
Conformance suite: run a curated subset of Solidity‚Äôs tests; publish pass/fail matrix and deprecations.
Codegen details and lowering strategy
Yul to NeoVM mapping
Map Yul variables to NeoVM stack/local frames with spill to ByteStrings when needed.
Implement a small IR normalization pass: A-normal form, bounds checks insertion, revert points.
Control flow: structured if/for/while into NeoVM jumps; ensure structured exception handling via revert conventions.
ABI boundary: canonicalize all external function entry points into decoder stubs that dispatch to internal functions with strongly typed parameters.
Runtime call conventions
Calldata/memory: ABI decode into memory view; pass references as ByteStrings; avoid excessive copying.
Return data: ABI encode to ByteString; Neo return is the encoded ByteString that off-chain tool decodes.
Testing strategy
Unit tests
Runtime primitives: memory allocator, keccak256 vectors (KECCAK-256), ecrecover vectors, ABI encode/decode for all canonical types.
Contract tests
ERC-20/721/1155 behaviors; access control (Ownable, Roles); pausable; reentrancy guard.
Differential tests
Compile selected Solidity contracts to EVM and run against Ganache/Anvil and to NeoVM; compare high-level outcomes where semantics are intended to match (function outputs, events), excluding gas and msg.value aspects.
Fuzzing
ABI fuzzing for function signatures and types; storage collision fuzzing; revert/panic surfaces.
Known limitations and how to handle them
msg.value/payable
Not supported; always zero. Provide helpers for NEP-17/WGAS-style value transfer and a porting guide.
delegatecall
Unsupported in MVP. Fail compile with explicit message; provide refactoring patterns (libraries with explicit storage context).
create/create2
Disabled initially. Deployment via toolchain. Documented upgrade path if contract-initiated deploy is permitted and safe.
Gas semantics
gasleft(), gas stipend, EIP-150 semantics: not applicable; return sentinel values or fail compile where unsafe.
Inline assembly
Disabled initially; consider selective support later with strict validation.
Performance considerations
Keccak and ABI encoding dominate CPU; optimize critical code paths in managed code first, consider a native contract for keccak if needed.
Avoid deep stack thrash: lift expressions and reuse temporaries; small SSA-like pass.
Storage access batching: coalesce storage reads/writes in generated code where semantics allow.
Security and determinism
Enforce 256-bit bounds explicitly at runtime boundaries to avoid BigInteger surprises.
Ensure all cryptographic operations are deterministic and bounded in runtime cost.
Carefully document and test reentrancy patterns; Neo call semantics differ from EVM‚Äîrecommend reentrancy guards and provide a vetted library.
Team and timeline
Skills needed
1 compiler engineer (IR/codegen/Yul) full-time.
1 runtime/VM engineer (NeoVM, syscalls, perf).
1 tooling engineer (Hardhat/Foundry plugins, deployer, RPC adapters).
0.5 QA/devrel (tests, docs, examples).
Rough duration
MVP (M0‚ÄìM2): ~4‚Äì6 months.
Production-ready with tooling and audit (M3‚ÄìM6): ~8‚Äì12 months.
Early decisions to unblock implementation
Confirm approach: Yul backend inside solc vs standalone transpiler. Recommendation: Yul backend for maintainability and optimization reuse.
Decide on ecrecover path:
If Neo N3 exposes secp256k1 verify/recover: use syscall. Else, plan audited managed impl.
Decide address mapping strategy:
Registry contract that maps 20-byte ‚ÄúEVM addresses‚Äù to Neo script hashes; deployer populates it and plugins use it automatically.
Pick supported Solidity version range (e.g., 0.8.24‚Äì0.8.latest) and freeze for MVP.
If you share your preferences for the Yul-backend vs. transpiler approach, required Solidity versions, and whether you need ecrecover in MVP, I can turn this into a concrete technical design with module boundaries, data structures, and initial task tickets."

1. Break down into major phases using swarm_think
2. Create specialized worker teams for each phase
3. Establish success criteria and checkpoints
4. Implement feedback loops and adaptation
5. Aggregate and synthesize all worker outputs
6. Deliver comprehensive solution with consensus

‚ö° CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION WITH CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL:

The Hive Mind MUST use Claude Code's Task tool for actual agent execution:

‚úÖ CORRECT Pattern:
[Single Message - All Agents Spawned Concurrently]:
  Task("Researcher", "Research patterns and best practices...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder", "Implement core features...", "coder")
  Task("Tester", "Create comprehensive tests...", "tester")
  Task("Analyst", "Analyze performance metrics...", "analyst")
  TodoWrite { todos: [8-10 todos ALL in ONE call] }

‚ùå WRONG Pattern:
Message 1: Task("agent1", ...)
Message 2: Task("agent2", ...)
Message 3: TodoWrite { single todo }
// This breaks parallel coordination!

Remember:
- Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn ALL agents in ONE message
- MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup, not agent execution
- Batch ALL TodoWrite operations (5-10+ todos minimum)
- Execute ALL file operations concurrently
- Store multiple memories simultaneously

üöÄ BEGIN HIVE MIND EXECUTION:

Initialize the swarm now with the configuration above. Use your collective intelligence to solve the objective efficiently. The Queen must coordinate, workers must collaborate, and the hive must think as one.

Remember: You are not just coordinating agents - you are orchestrating a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts.
