//! Fuzz target: NeoRuntime VM must never panic at the host level on any
//! arbitrary byte sequence treated as bytecode.
//!
//! Invariant under test: `NeoRuntime::execute(bytes, &[])` is total at the
//! host level — for any `&[u8]`, the runtime returns either an `Ok(_)` with
//! a runtime exception or an `Err(_)` runtime error, and never produces a
//! Rust-side panic, OOM, or aborts the host process.
//!
//! This complements `fuzz_target_disasm`, which exercises only the
//! disassembler. Here we run the bytes THROUGH the VM bridge: malformed
//! CALLT operands, invalid opcodes, stack-imbalance, JMPs out of range,
//! truncated PUSHDATA, etc. — all must funnel into a graceful runtime
//! exception path. A crash at this level would be a DoS vector for any
//! operator running compiled contracts.
//!
//! Termination: the default `RuntimeConfig` ships with `gas_limit =
//! 10_000_000`, which is too high for fuzzing — many opcodes cost only
//! 1 gas, so a tight `JMP -1` loop burns ~10M iterations before tripping
//! out-of-gas, costing >100ms per fuzz iteration. We override to a small
//! gas budget (`100_000`) so every fuzz iteration completes in <1ms while
//! still letting the bytecode reach all the interesting interpreter
//! branches (each opcode dispatch hit is what we want coverage on, not
//! billions of repeats of the same opcode).
