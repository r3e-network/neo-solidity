## Audit Snapshot

- Source type: `npm`
- Source path: `/Users/jinghuiliao/git/neo-solidity/third_party/famous-contracts/sources/@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol`

## NeoVM Adaptation Status

This upstream contract compiled successfully in the audit run with current `neo-solc`.

Recommended hardening before production deployment:

1. Review generated manifest permissions and remove wildcard entries when possible.
1. Run Neo-Express state-changing tests for your target workflows, not only read-only calls.
1. Validate semantic differences (for example `tx.origin`, payable semantics, callback models) for your integration context.

## Diagnostics

Total diagnostics captured: `442`

### By Severity

| Severity | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| warning | 442 |

### Most Common Codes

| Code | Count | Example |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| W200 | 324 | function 'sendValue' in 'ERC1967Proxy' overrides 'Proxy::sendValue' which is not marked 'virtual' |
| INVALID_STORAGE_RETURN | 82 | function 'getAddressSlot' return value 'AddressSlot' uses 'storage' data location (treated as Any) |
| W121 | 18 | duplicate constant state variable 'IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT' detected while merging libraries |
| MANIFEST_WILDCARD_CONTRACT | 6 | contract 'Proxy' requires wildcard contract manifest permissions (contract='*') due to dynamic contract calls. This is riskier than fixed contract hashes; use --deny-wildcard-contracts to make this a hard error. |
| W111 | 4 | function 'fallback' is marked `payable`, but Neo N3 has no native coin transfer; the modifier is accepted for compatibility but has no effect. Use onNEP17Payment(address, uint256, bytes) to handle incoming NEP-17 token payments. |
| W116 | 4 | function 'fallback' has payable modifier which has no effect on Neo N3. Use onNEP17Payment callback to receive token payments. |
| W105 | 3 | function 'fallback' has no effect on Neo N3. Use onNEP17Payment(address from, uint256 amount, bytes data) to handle incoming token payments. |
| VALIDATION_WARNING | 1 | abstract contract 'Proxy' has 1 unimplemented function(s): [_implementation] |
