## Audit Snapshot

- Status: ✅ pass
- Source type: `npm`
- Source path: `/Users/jinghuiliao/git/neo-solidity/third_party/famous-contracts/sources/@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol`
- Primary issue: No primary issue recorded.

## NeoVM Adaptation Status

This upstream contract compiled successfully in the audit run with current `neo-solc`.

Recommended hardening before production deployment:

1. Review generated manifest permissions and remove wildcard entries when possible.
1. Run Neo-Express state-changing tests for your target workflows, not only read-only calls.
1. Validate semantic differences (for example `tx.origin`, payable semantics, callback models) for your integration context.

## Diagnostics

Total diagnostics captured: `1443`

### By Severity

| Severity | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| warning | 1441 |
| error | 2 |

### Most Common Codes

| Code | Count | Example |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| W200 | 1360 | function 'checkOnERC721Received' in 'ERC165' overrides 'Context::checkOnERC721Received' which is not marked 'virtual' |
| W121 | 70 | duplicate constant state variable 'GENERIC' detected while merging libraries |
| MANIFEST_WILDCARD_CONTRACT | 4 | contract 'Context' requires wildcard contract manifest permissions (contract='*') due to dynamic contract calls. This is riskier than fixed contract hashes; use --deny-wildcard-contracts to make this a hard error. |
| W106 | 3 | function 'supportsInterface' (EIP-165) is unnecessary on Neo N3. Neo uses the manifest 'supportedstandards' array for interface detection, which the compiler populates automatically. |
| RAW | 2 | [info][NEP-11] NEP-11 `Transfer` event has 3 parameter(s), expected 4. |
| W104 | 2 | function 'transferFrom' with 3 parameters (ERC-721 pattern) detected. NEP-11 uses transfer(to, tokenId, data) with 3 parameters instead. Authorization is via Runtime.checkWitness(owner), not msg.sender. |
| W114 | 2 | NFT contract (has ownerOf) but missing onNEP11Payment callback. Other contracts cannot send NFTs to this contract. |
