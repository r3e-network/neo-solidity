## NeoVM Adaptation Status

This upstream contract compiled successfully in the audit run with current `neo-solc`.

Recommended hardening before production deployment:

1. Review generated manifest permissions and remove wildcard entries when possible.
1. Run Neo-Express state-changing tests for your target workflows, not only read-only calls.
1. Validate semantic differences (for example `tx.origin`, payable semantics, callback models) for your integration context.

## Diagnostics

Total diagnostics captured: `4`

### By Severity

| Severity | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| warning | 3 |
| error | 1 |

### Most Common Codes

| Code | Count | Example |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| RAW | 1 | [info][NEP-17] NEP-17 `transfer` method has 2 parameter(s), spec expects 4. See STANDARDS_MAPPING.md for details. |
| W101 | 1 | function 'transfer' has 2 parameters (ERC-20 pattern). NEP-17 requires 4 parameters: transfer(from, to, amount, data). The `from` address is verified via Runtime.checkWitness() and `data` (type Any) is forwarded to the recipient's onNEP17Payment callback. |
| W103 | 1 | ERC-20 method(s) [approve, allowance, transferfrom] detected. These are not part of the NEP-17 spec; Neo uses Runtime.checkWitness() for authorization instead of the approve/allowance pattern. You may keep them as extensions, but they will not contribute to NEP-17 standard detection. |
| W113 | 1 | Contract has transfer function but no onNEP17Payment callback. Other contracts cannot send tokens to this contract. |

Full diagnostic payloads are kept in `docs/data/famous-contracts-audit-results.json`; this page summarizes them so the docs remain navigable.
