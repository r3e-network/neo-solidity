## NeoVM Adaptation Status

This upstream contract compiled successfully in the audit run with current `neo-solc`.

Recommended hardening before production deployment:

1. Review generated manifest permissions and remove wildcard entries when possible.
1. Run Neo-Express state-changing tests for your target workflows, not only read-only calls.
1. Validate semantic differences (for example `tx.origin`, payable semantics, callback models) for your integration context.

## Diagnostics

| Severity | Code | Message |
