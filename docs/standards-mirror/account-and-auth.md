title: Account & Authentication — ERC ↔ Neo Mirror
description: Ethereum signature, ownership, and account-abstraction standards mirrored to Neo's native witness model and idiomatic C# patterns.

# Account & Authentication

Twenty-four standards covering ownership (full / light / governance-mediated), off-chain
signatures (legacy + modern + endorsement), smart-contract signature verification,
NFT-aware signature validation, stealth-address privacy, account abstraction,
EOA-as-contract proposals, NFT-bound accounts, generalised contract-linked services,
paymaster handshakes, modular wallet plugins, scoped permission grants, and SIWE
(single-chain + generalised). Most of these are elaborate workarounds for Ethereum's
"EOA can only do ECDSA" limitation; Neo's witness model handles the same use cases at
the protocol level.
