# Protocol-Level EIPs

These EIPs change Ethereum's protocol itself — fee market, opcodes, transaction
formats — rather than introducing application-layer standards. Most are no-ops on
Neo because Neo's protocol already addresses the underlying concern. The third
tab here typically shows the **Neo equivalent mechanism** rather than user-level
contract code.
