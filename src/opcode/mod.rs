//! Canonical Neo N3 VM opcode definitions.
//!
//! The variant names follow the canonical Neo N3 opcode spelling
//! (e.g. `JMP_L`, `JMPIF_L`, `NEWARRAY_T`, `LDSFLD0`..`LDSFLD6`,
//! `PUSH0`..`PUSH16`). These deliberately mix digits, underscores,
//! and uppercase letters to match the spec, so we silence the
//! camel-case lint locally instead of mangling the names.
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]
//!
//! This module is the **single source of truth** for every NeoVM opcode
//! byte value used anywhere in the compiler, runtime simulator, and
//! disassembler. Code that emits or interprets NeoVM bytecode must go
//! through [`OpCode`] rather than hardcoding byte literals — that way
//! renumbering, validation, gas accounting, and disassembler output
//! stay in lockstep with the spec.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Opcodes fall into two categories:
//!
//! * **Fixed** opcodes ([`OpCode::ADD`], [`OpCode::JMP`], …) have a
//!   single, named variant and a single byte value.
//! * **Indexed** opcode families ([`OpCode::PUSH0`]..[`OpCode::PUSH16`],
//!   [`OpCode::LDLOC0`]..[`OpCode::LDLOC6`], [`OpCode::LDLOC`],
//!   [`OpCode::LDSFLD0`].., [`OpCode::LDARG0`].., [`OpCode::STLOC0`]..,
//!   [`OpCode::STSFLD0`].., [`OpCode::STARG0`]..) share a byte
//!   prefix/suffix. Use the [`OpCode::push_small`], [`OpCode::ldloc`],
//!   [`OpCode::stloc`], [`OpCode::ldarg`], [`OpCode::starg`],
//!   [`OpCode::ldsfld`], [`OpCode::stsfld`] constructors instead of
//!   computing `0x10 + n`.
//!
//! # Variants for data-bearing opcodes
//!
//! [`OpCode::PUSHDATA1`] / [`OpCode::PUSHDATA2`] / [`OpCode::PUSHDATA4`]
//! and [`OpCode::PUSHINT8`]..[`OpCode::PUSHINT256`] are all distinct
//! opcodes that the VM dispatches on. [`OpCode::push_data`] and
//! [`OpCode::push_int`] select the right one based on operand size.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```
//! use neo_devpack_solidity::opcode::OpCode;
//!
//! let mut script = Vec::new();
//! script.push(OpCode::ABORT.byte());
//! script.push(OpCode::PUSH0.byte());
//! assert_eq!(script, vec![0x38, 0x10]);
//! ```
